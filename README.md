# Guided Project - Light
A guided project from chapter 1 of Apple's
[App Development with Swift](https://itun.es/us/SoKQib.l)
book:

> So far in this lesson, you've learned the basics of Xcode and Interface Builder.
> You'll now apply your knowledge of these tools by building a project.
>
> By the end of this Guided Project, you'll have created an app, called Light, that
> changes the screen from black to white, and back again, whenever the user taps a
> button. To successfully build the light, you'll need to use Xcode documentation,
> set breakpoints, and create outlets and actions.
